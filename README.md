Hello world! I'm Ryan and I'm relatively new to coding. I'm currently taking Harvard's CS50x MOOC course and learning C as well as C# (with Unity). I like to make things, including music, visual art, and games. I've spent the last five years in Tallahassee, FL getting my bachelor's degree and playing and recording music. I'll be living in California starting in 2017. Nice to meet you!
